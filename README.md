# INA-course-project
This repository contains the group project implemented during the Introduction to Network Analysis course. Its aim is to produce a tool for producing music with graph traversal. The data is stored in a graph where nodes are notes of certain pitch and duration, while the links between nodes represent succession in a melody. 
With traversing the graph in different ways, new melodies are obtained. 

Datasets used: 

Requriements:
